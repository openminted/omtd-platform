                                            OMTD platform that offers services and functionalities for text and data mining,
                                            allowing users (e.g. researchers, miners, etc.) to browse resources, to add their
                                            own components, tools, applications, corpora and other data, and build their own workflows.

                                            serving as a gateway to language data, including publications, corpora tagsets,
                                            ontologies, models, etc., and to text and data mining applications.

                                            The primary focus of OMTD is on Open Access (OA) content, as this is provided by

                                            In addition, under specific bilateral agreements, OMTD may also accept closed
                                            access content provided by publishers or scholarly societies or other bodies,
                                            and make it available to end users for text mining purposes only.
